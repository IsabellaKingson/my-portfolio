        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Isabella Kingson. I am a homegrown Minnesotan orginating
          from Minneapolis, but I currently reside in Saint Paul. I live with my
          husband, Nick, and our two cats, Ruby and Stanley. I am a current
          student enrolled in the Coding Boot Camp through the University of
          Minnesota. I have been an employee in many capacities, from cashier
          all the way to management, at Punch Neapolitan Pizza for the last 6
          years. During the pandemic, our company created an online ordering
          system. There were a lot of hiccups at first, but eventually it became
          a common way to make our product more easily accessible to the public.
          I had been curious about coding for same time, but I wanted to know
          how it all worked. I began to wonder what had gone wrong initially,
          and how had they fixed it? As I began learning on my own, I stumbled
          across the U of M bootcamp and thought it was an opportunity I
          couldn't pass up. I hope that this experience will lead to a new
          career in software development.

              <p>
                This is a project I created for boot camp students who were
                going through the Prework to study the basics of HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, and Git. I used it as a guide to learn the basics of
                these concepts and as a reference point for future work.

              <p>
                This project is a landing page for the social media management
                company Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. or 'Horiseon'.
                My motivation for this project was to refine the starter code so
                that it would meet accessiblity standards and have improved SEO.
